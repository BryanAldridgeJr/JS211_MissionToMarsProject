# First Test

# First thing i need to do is create a CrewMember class and add the properties Name, Job, SpecialSkill and Ship

# Next i will need to add a new crewmeber named Crew member on where his properties will be 'Rick Martinez', 'pilot', 'chemistry' and no ship for him.

# This should allow the first test to pass.

# Second Test 

# I will first need to create a new class that will extend off of CrewMember and this class will be called Ship with the properties name, type, ability and crew.

# Then i will create a function called enterShip in my CrewMember class that will be calling my other new function in my ship class that will .push crew members.
